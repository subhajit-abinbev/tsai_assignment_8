# CIFAR-100 Image Classification with ResNet-56

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a ResNet-56 architecture from scratch to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The model achieves **73.84% highest test accuracy** after 100 epochs of training with optimal hyperparameters found using Learning Rate Finder.

## üéØ Targets

- ‚úÖ Build ResNet-56 architecture from scratch for CIFAR-100
- ‚úÖ Implement automated Learning Rate Finder using `torch-lr-finder`
- ‚úÖ Use OneCycleLR scheduler for super-convergence
- ‚úÖ Apply data augmentation with Albumentations
- ‚úÖ Achieve >70% test accuracy on CIFAR-100
- ‚úÖ Train efficiently with SGD + Momentum + Nesterov

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **BasicBlock**: Two 3√ó3 convolutions with skip connections
- ‚úÖ **Batch Normalization**: After every convolution
- ‚úÖ **Kaiming Initialization**: For better convergence
- ‚úÖ **Global Average Pooling**: Reduces overfitting vs fully connected layers

## üîß Training Configuration

### Optimizer: SGD with Nesterov Momentum
```python
optimizer = optim.SGD(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.1,                  # Found via LR Finder
    momentum=0.9,
    weight_decay=5e-4,
    nesterov=True
)
```

### Learning Rate Scheduler: MultiStepLR
```python
scheduler = MultiStepLR(
    optimizer,
    milestones=[40, 70, 85],  # Drop LR at these epochs
    gamma=0.2                 # Multiply LR by 0.2 at each milestone
)

# Learning rate schedule:
# Epochs 1-40:  LR = 0.1
# Epochs 41-70: LR = 0.02  (0.1 √ó 0.2)
# Epochs 71-85: LR = 0.004 (0.02 √ó 0.2)
# Epochs 86-100: LR = 0.0008 (0.004 √ó 0.2)
```

### Data Augmentation (Albumentations)
```python
# Training Augmentations
- HorizontalFlip(p=0.5)
- Affine(translate=¬±10%, scale=0.9-1.1, rotate=¬±15¬∞, p=0.5)
- CoarseDropout(1 hole, 16√ó16 pixels, p=0.5)
- ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1, p=0.5)
- Normalize(mean=[0.5071, 0.4867, 0.4408], std=[0.2675, 0.2565, 0.2761])

# Test Augmentations
- Normalize only (same mean/std as training)
```

## üìà Learning Rate Finder

### LR Finder Configuration
```python
start_lr = 1e-4
end_lr = 1.0
num_iter = 200
```

### LR Finder Results
- **Suggested Learning Rate**: 0.1 (1e-1)
- **Method**: Fallback method (minimum loss / 10)
- **Loss Range**: 4.67 ‚Üí 4.37 (decreasing) ‚Üí explosion at >0.5

![LR Finder Plot](output/CNN_Model_lr_finder.png)

### Why LR = 0.1 Works Well
- In the steep descent region of the loss curve
- Standard starting point for SGD on CIFAR datasets
- Well-tested in ResNet papers
- Balances fast convergence with training stability

## üî¨ Key Technical Decisions

### Why ResNet-56?
- ‚úÖ Deep enough to learn complex features (56 layers)
- ‚úÖ Skip connections prevent vanishing gradients
- ‚úÖ Proven architecture for CIFAR datasets
- ‚úÖ Compact size (~862K parameters)

### Why SGD over Adam/AdamW?
- ‚úÖ Better generalization for image classification
- ‚úÖ Works well with OneCycleLR super-convergence
- ‚úÖ Standard choice in ResNet papers
- ‚úÖ Nesterov momentum improves convergence

### Why OneCycleLR?
- ‚úÖ Faster convergence than step/cosine schedulers
- ‚úÖ Enables super-convergence (high LR in middle)
- ‚úÖ Automatic warmup and annealing
- ‚úÖ Better final accuracy in fewer epochs

### Why Albumentations?
- ‚úÖ Faster than torchvision transforms
- ‚úÖ More augmentation options
- ‚úÖ GPU acceleration support
- ‚úÖ Industry standard for competitions

## üìà Possible Improvements

### Model Architecture
- [ ] Try ResNet-110 or WideResNet for higher capacity
- [ ] Add SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) blocks
- [ ] Implement Cutmix or Mixup augmentation
- [ ] Use label smoothing (epsilon=0.1)

### Training Strategy
- [ ] Train for 200-300 epochs
- [ ] Use higher max_lr (0.2-0.3) with OneCycleLR
- [ ] Implement progressive image size training
- [ ] Add test-time augmentation (TTA)

### Data Augmentation
- [ ] Try AutoAugment or RandAugment
- [ ] Add Gaussian noise
- [ ] Use stronger CoarseDropout
- [ ] Apply color jittering

### Expected Results with Improvements
- ResNet-110: ~75-76%
- WideResNet-28-10: ~78-80%
- WideResNet + Mixup + AutoAugment: ~82-85%
